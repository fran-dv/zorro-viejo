# Zorro Viejo Beverages E‚Äëcommerce

> üöß **Work in progress:** This project is under active development. The available demo is not production ready, and it is for showcase purposes only. You‚Äôll see mock data and placeholders.

**A freelance project**: e-commerce platform for buying alcoholic beverages. This project aims to deliver a clean, mobile‚Äëfirst shopping experience for customers and a user‚Äëfriendly interface for the admin, keeping the product catalog always up to date. Per client requirements, the checkout flow replaces a traditional payment gateway with WhatsApp redirection, while maintaining internal order tracking for reliability.

**Live demo:** [_work-in-progress demo available here._](https://zorro-viejo.vercel.app/)
